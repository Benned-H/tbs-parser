# tbs-parser
Implementing an executable semantic parser for a modified version of the Tactical Behavior Specification

To generate random strings from the current TBS grammar, run the command:

  python3 parser.py

Current code:

* Randomly samples non-intersecting obstacles with unique identifiers
* GUI plots the current world model of these obstacles and the map boundary
